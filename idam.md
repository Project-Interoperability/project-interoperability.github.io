[Identity and Access Management (IdAM)](http://www.idmanagement.gov/) is a diverse portfolio of services and processes that provides identity management, authentication, and authorization. IdAM includes the all aspects of a user’s digital identity lifecycle, from pre-onboarding through termination. IdAM allows an organization to ensure that access to its sensitive information and facilities is only granted to the appropriate individuals and audited accordingly. The [Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Roadmap & Implementation Guidance](http://www.idmanagement.gov/documents/ficam-roadmap-and-implementation-guidance) provides a government-wide architecture for IdAM.
